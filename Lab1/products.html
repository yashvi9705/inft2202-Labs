        <p>One of our teams past projects, was a Database for Lake Ridge Healthcare Centre,
             located in Oshawa Ontario. The goal of this project was to improve functionality and security
             of information in the database. We included information on rooms, charges, patients, cost centres, and much more.

        <p>Another one of our projects is a Website, used for a companies sales people to 
            record their clients, and calls between them. It included a fully function database,
            that took into account emails, and passwords to allow users to log in and out safely. We
            also implemented hashing on passwords, for secure logins.

        <p>We also created a testing file, used to test a clothing sales site, for errors 
            in searching, purchasing and selection of 
            clothing. The testing file was able to move through the website 
            on its own, finding errors along the way,
            and giving an error message for said errors.
